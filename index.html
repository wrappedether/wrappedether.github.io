        <h1>WHAT IS WETC?</h1>
        <p>Put plainly, wETC is "wrapped ETC" but let's start by introducing the players.</p>
        
        <h2>FIRST, THERE'S ETHER TOKEN</h2>
        <p>Ether or ETC is the native currency built on the Ethereum Classic blockchain, the original Ethereum Virtual Machine.</p>
        
        <h2>SECOND, THERE ARE ALT TOKENS</h2>
        <p>When a dApp (decentralized app) is built on top of the Ethereum Classic blockchain it usually implements its own form of token. Think of stablecoins like USDT and USDC.</p>
        
        <h2>FINALLY THE ERC-20 STANDARD</h2>
        <p>ERC-20 is a standard developed after the release of ETC that defines how tokens are transferred and how to keep a consistent record of those transfers among tokens on the Ethereum Classic network.</p>
        
        <h1>WHY YOU NEED WETC</h1>
        
        <h2>ETC DOESN’T CONFORM TO ITS OWN ERC-20 STANDARD</h2>
        <p>As mentioned above, ETC was the proto-token of the Ethereum Classic Alt tokens, which means it was built before the ERC-20 standard existed.</p>
        
        <h2>WRAPPING ETC ALLOWS YOU TO TRADE DIRECTLY WITH ALT TOKENS</h2>
        <p>The reason you need wETC is to be able to trade ETC for other ERC-20 tokens on decentralized platforms. Because decentralized platforms running on Ethereum Classic use smart contracts to facilitate trades directly between users, every user needs to have the same standardized format for every token they trade. This ensures tokens don’t get lost in translation.</p>
        
        <h1>READY TO WRAP?</h1>
        
        <h2>SO THIS IS AWKWARD...YOU DON'T ACTUALLY WRAP ANYTHING</h2>
        <p>When you "wrap" ETC, you aren't really wrapping so much as trading via a smart contract for an equal token called wETC. If you want to get plain ETC back you need to "unwrap" it. AKA trade wETC back for plain ETC.</p>
        
        <h1>THE FUTURE OF WETC</h1>
        
        <h2>HOPEFULLY, THERE'S NO FUTURE FOR WETC</h2>
        <p>Steps are being taken to update the ETC codebase to make it compliant with its own ERC-20 standards. Weird, we know. Additionally, ERC-20 may be replaced by other standards as problems and solutions arise. There's already a ERC223 in the works.</p>
